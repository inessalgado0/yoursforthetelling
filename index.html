    <section class="container reveal" id="s2"><p>2. Would you prefer the tale of the three tall, lanky beanpoles?</p>
       
            <a href="#s16">Yup, I'd like that better.
            </a>
            <a href="#s3">No, not interested.

    <section class="container reveal" id="s3"><p>3. Would you rather read the one about the three rather common or garden shrubs?</p>
       
            <a href="#s17">Yup, I'd like that better.
            </a>
            <a href="#s21">It's a no as well.

    <section class="container reveal" id="s4"><p>4. Once upon a time, there were three wee pees dressed in green dozing cosily in their pod. They had chubby, moon-shaped faces and breathed through their funny little nozzles, snoring softly and euphoniously.</p>
       
            <a href="#s9">I'd prefer another description.
            </a>
            <a href="#s5">This one will do.
            </a>

    <section class="container reveal" id="s5"><p>5. Their sleep was dreamless. The fact is that these creatures never dream.</p>
       
            <a href="#s6">I'd rather they did dream.
            </a>
            <a href="#s7">I don't mind they never dream.
            </a>
    </section >

    <section class="container reveal" id="s6"><p>6. They were dreaming. The fact is these little cratures are always dreaming, and their nights are quite deliciously oneiric.</p>
       
            <a href="#s11">I want to know what they are dreaming.
            </a>
            <a href="#s7">It's neither here nor there to me if they dream.
            </a>
    </section >

    <section class="container reveal" id="s7"><p>7. Their cute little tootsies were muffled in cozy socks, and they wore black velvet mittens in bed.</p>
       
            <a href="#s8">I'd prefer mittens of another colour.</a>
            <a href="#s10">I'm happy with black.
            </a>
    </section >

    <section class="container reveal" id="s8"><p>8. They wore midnight blue velvet mittens in bed.</p>
       
            <a href="#s7">I'd prefer mittens of another colour.
            </a>
            <a href="#s10">I have no objection to blue.

    <section class="container reveal" id="s9"><p>9. Once upon a time there were three wee peas who travelled the open road. In the evening, foot-sore and weary, they would drop off to sleep in no time at all.</p>
       
            <a href="#s5">I wish to know what happened next.</a>
            <a href="#s21">I don't care what happens next.
            </a>
    </section>

    <section class="container reveal" id="s10"><p>10. All three were dreaming the same dream; for they loved each other tenderly and, old inseparables that they were, always dreamed alike.</p>
       
            <a href="#s11">I'd wish to know their dream.
            </a>
            <a href="#s12">I don't mind what they dream.
            </a>
    </section>

    <section class="container reveal" id="s11"><p>11. They were dreaming they had gone to fetch their soup from the soup kitchen and, upon opening their billy-cans, discovered it to be vetch soup. Sickened with horror, they awoke.</p>
       
            <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/vetch" target="_blank">I wish to know why they awoke sickened with horror. (draw your own conclusions)
            </a>
            <a href="#s12">It's all the same to me.
            </a>
    </section>

    <section class="container reveal" id="s12"><p>12. “eeky-peeky!” they cried as they popped open their optics. “Eeky-peeky! What a ghastly dream we've just dreamed!” “A bad omen,” the first pea said. “Amen,” said the second pea, “I feel quite glum.” “Don't let it upset you so,” said the third pea, who was the smartest of the three; “the point is not to mope and fret but to understand, right? Just you listen while I analyse it all…”</p>
       
            <a href="#s15">I can't wait to know his interpretation of the dream.
            </a>
            <a href="#s13">I'd rather learn how the other two responded.
            </a>
    </section>

    <section class="container reveal" id="s13"><p>
        13. “Come off it!” piped the first pea. “Since when were you able to analyse dreams?”
            “Yes, since when?” piped the second pea.
    </p>
       
            <a href="#s14">I too wish to know since when.
            </a>
            <a href="#s14">(go to the same page as the other option, you'll not be any the wiser.)
            </a>
        </section>

    <section class="container reveal" id="s14"><p>14. “Since when?” cried the third pea. “How should I know? The fact is, I analyse them, OK? you'll soon see!”</p>
       
            <a href="#s15">I too wish to see.
            </a>
            <a href="#s15">(this will proceed likewise, as you won't see a thing.)
            </a>
    </section>

    <section class="container reveal" id="s15"><p>15. “OK, let's see!” said his brothers. “I don't care much for your irony,” the other replied; “you shan't see a thing. Besides, hasn't your feeling of horror dimmed and even faded quite away since this rather heated exchange began? So why bother to stir up the sink of your leguminous unconscious? Let's go and bathe in the fountain, rather, and greet this bright m orning in that state of holy euphoria that is hygiene's own reward!” No sooner said that done. Slipping out of their pod, they rolled downhill and scampered merrily off to the theatre of their ablutions.</p>
       
            <a href="#s16">I wish to know what happens at the theater of their ablutions.
            </a>
            <a href="#s21">I don't wish to see what happens.
            </a>

    <section class="container reveal" id="s16"><p>16. Three tall, lanky beanpoles were watching them.</p>
       
            <a href="#s21">I don't care much for the three tall lanky beanpoles.</a>
            <a href="#s18">I like the look of them.
            </a>
    </section>

    <section class="container reveal" id="s17"><p>17. Three rather common or garden shrubs were watching them.</p>
       
            <a href="#s21">I don't care for the three common or garden shrubs.</a>
            <a href="#s18">Contrariwise, they rather take my fancy.</a>
    </section>

    <section class="container reveal" id="s18"><p>18. Observing that they were being ogled, the three sprightly peas, who were very bashful, took to their heels.</p>
       
            <a href="#s19">I wish to know what they did next.
            </a>
            <a href="#s21">It's immaterial to me.</a>
    </section>

    <section class="container reveal" id="s19"><p>19. They skedaddled back to their pod, pulled down the lid over themselves and fell fast asleep again.</p>
       
            <a href="#s20">I wish to know the sequel.</a>
            <a href="#s21">I don't care for a sequel.</a>
    </section>

    <section class="container reveal" id="s20"><p>20. There is no sequel. The tale is finished. Finished!</p>
    </section>

    <section class="container reveal" id="s21"><p>21. In this case too, the tale is finished. Ended!</p></section>
